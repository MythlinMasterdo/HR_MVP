## Sub-Heading ##
Showing you your income possibilities

## Summary ##
The YouVsMarkZuckerBerg calculator compares a users income to Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg and shows how long it took him to earn your annual income. Other features include putting Mark's income in perspective for the users and adding in some fun facts about what Mark could buy with his 2015 income.

## Problem ##
My app just about solves no real world problems. The only possible problem my app solves is stopping people from being arrogant about their income.

## Solution ##
My app takes any income and compares it to Mark Zuckerbergs income, which will make any person feel small.

## Quote from You ##
I think this app is a great way to stop people from being arrogant and to show you how little you really are in this world.

## How to Get Started ##
To get started I created a Express server and a MongoDB database then connected AngularJS to Express and MongoDB, then I created a input and stored the incomes on my html page in my DB. After storing the incomes I ran them through Angular and called my support JS functions that give the appropriate numbers back to the user.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
Get out there and create something so that one day you can have one of these projects made about you!
